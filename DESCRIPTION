Description: Energy rebound is the unanticipated reduction of energy savings
             from an energy efficiency upgrade resulting from 
             behavior change and economy-wide effects.
             `ReboundTools` provides assistance for energy rebound analysis.
             Many functions perform analysis calculations to move from 
             known parameters to rebound estimates.
             Other functions create rebound graphs in 
             energy, cost, and preference spaces.
             The functions in this package were used for the 
             analyses and graphs in the paper **********.

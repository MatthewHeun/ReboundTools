Description: Energy rebound is the unanticipated reduction 
             of the benefits of energy efficiency 
             due to behavior change and economy-wide effects.
             `ReboundTools` provides assistance for energy rebound analysis.
             Many functions perform analysis calculations to move from 
             known parameters to rebound estimates.
             Other functions create rebound graphs in 
             energy, expenditure, and preference spaces.
             The functions in this package were used for the 
             analyses and graphs in the paper **********.
